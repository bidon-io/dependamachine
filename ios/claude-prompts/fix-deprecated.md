### Adapters to fix:
{{ADAPTERS}}

### Deprecated warnings by adapter:
{{ISSUES}}

### Release Notes URLs:

### Instructions:
1. Read the deprecated warnings above carefully
2. For each adapter, fetch its Release Notes URL to find migration guide
3. Fix deprecated code in each adapter's `{{ADAPTERS_DIR}}/<AdapterName>/` directory
4. Run SwiftLint to format code:
   ```bash
   ./lint
   ```
5. Commit and push changes for ALL adapters in ONE commit:
   ```bash
   rm -f deprecated_warnings.txt build_output.log
   git add {{ADAPTERS_DIR}}/*/
   git commit -m "fix: migrate deprecated APIs in <list adapters>"
   git push
   ```

### IMPORTANT:
- Fix ALL listed adapters in this task
- Only modify code under `{{ADAPTERS_DIR}}/` directories
- Do NOT change `Podfile`, `Podfile.lock`, or core SDK code
- If you cannot fix an adapter, report what you found and continue with others
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" footer to commits
- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By" line to commits
- Write descriptive commit message listing what deprecated APIs were migrated
